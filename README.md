### Open Your Browser

Log in to OnlyFans

### Get The Required Values From Your Browser

You should be using Chrome or another Chromium based browser for this like Microsoft Edge.

You can either click F12 or CTRL + SHIFT + I to open the dev console.

There is 2 values you should get and note somewhere, first one is the User-Agent which you can get by pasting the code "navigator.userAgent" **WITHOUT THE PARANTHESIS** on the Console tab and clicking enter. You should note that result somewhere, once that's done you should get the access-token.

To do that go to the Application tab on the dev tools. (You may need to click the ![](https://i.imgur.com/WDIVqzh.png) button) Once there navigate to the Cookies section. [Shown Below]

You should then copy the value next to "sess" by double clicking it and using the CTRL + C combination.

You should also note this next to your User-Agent.

### Using The Tool

The tool itself is pretty easy to use. All you need to do is paste the text you have just copied to the corresponding fields. **BUT BE CAREFUL, DO NOT PASTE THE QUOTATION MARKS WHEN PASTING THE USER AGENT! YOU WILL NEED TO LOG IN TO ONLYFANS AGAIN!**
